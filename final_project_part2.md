### Target Audience
The target audience I hope to reach with this story is the general public, specifically millenials with a wide range of orchestra knowledge. I would like the general population to be aware of and care about the issue of gender representation of composers, and I'd like to inform them of ways to improve the situation, no matter their level of involvement in the arts.

### Identifying Individuals to Interview
With the target audience in mind, I gathered 3 individuals in their early 20s (2 male, 1 female) with a range of orchestra knowledge. One individual attended music school and currently works in the arts sector, another was involved in orchestra and band in their childhood but has little involvement today, and the other has very little experience or knowledge of classical music.
