# Intended Audience
How did you decided on this audience?
What did you do in the final project to make it work for them?

Originally, I thought about having my audience be orchestra administrators, as they are the ones making decisions about the works that orchestras program. I ultimately decided to make my audience the general public because I feel it is possible for every person, no matter how involved they are in the orchestra world, to help solve this issue. I also feel that orchestra managers would have more incentive to make change if they received backlash from the general public.

Being that my audience includes a wide range of orchestra knowledge and experience, I felt that it was necessary to include points about how orchestras impact general public. I also made sure to keep my visualizations simple and easy to understand so that a wide range of people could comprehend them.
