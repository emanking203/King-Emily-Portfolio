# Intended Audience
How did you decided on this audience?
What did you do in the final project to make it work for them?

Originally, I thought about having my audience be orchestra administrators, as they are the ones making decisions about the works that orchestras program. I ultimately decided to make my audience the general public because I feel it is possible for every person, no matter how involved they are in the orchestra world, to help solve this issue. I also feel that orchestra managers would have more incentive to make change if they received backlash from the general public.

Being that my audience includes a wide range of orchestra knowledge and experience, I felt that it was necessary to include points about how orchestras impact general public. I also made sure to keep my visualizations simple and easy to understand so that a wide range of people could comprehend them. 

# Summary of Work
Design decisions made along the way
What did you learn?

Once I chose my target audience, I began to think about what information they would need in order to actually care about the story I'm telling. That's when I decided to include elements showing that orchestras impact their lives, like the map of orchestra locations and information on economic contribution. When thinking through the rest of my data, I realized that most of the visualizations could be kept very simple, such as with bar charts and pie charts, which I realized was quite beneficial for an audience that may have little experience with data visualizations. When thinking through the smaller details, I noticed that many of my visualizations focused on gender, and wanted to choose colors that aligned with what people tend to associate with gender but was still different from the normal blue and pink. I decided on teal for men and a red/orange for women, which also provided appealing contrast. Throughout the process, I also changed the titles of my visualizations several times to better reflect the data and tell the story. With this, I learned how improtant it is to focus on those details and how impactful they can be on telling I story. I also learned that experimenting with different versions and receiving feedback from fresh eyes is crucial to identifying those small details and creating a structure that actually tells the story as you intend. Overall, I've learned how important it is to keep the audience in mind with every decision I make, as they are the ones receiving the story and possibly changing because of it.
