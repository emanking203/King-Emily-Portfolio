## Why I Chose This Visualization
I chose this visualization because diversity in orchestras (including composers, musicians, and conductors) is a huge topic of discussion in the orchestra world, and it's important to analyze data to truly understand the issue. I felt that the message of this pie chart (which is that female composers are underperformed by top US orchestras, and are completely surpassed by Beethoven alone) could have been communicated more clearly and, being that the Women's Philharmonic Advocacy is the only organization I know of that collects this kind of data, I was concerned about how much the audience for this chart truly understands the issue. I wanted to create a visualization that communicates the same message, but in a way that is easier to read and understand. 

## Description of Process
When critiquing this visualization, I realized that the data itself is important, it just wasn't visualized very clearly. Using a pie chart was a good thought, because its simple to understand, so I knew that my redesign should probably be another kind of simple chart. I also realized that the huge amount of color was distracting from the data itself, so I knew my redesign had to have a simple color scheme. Another takeaway I had from the critique was that it was challenging to compare each of the categories, so I knew I wanted to set up my chart in a way to made it easy to see the differences between the composers. 

When doing the wireframes, I started out with a simple bar chart, all one
