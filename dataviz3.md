## Why I Chose This Visualization
I chose this visualization because diversity in orchestras (including composers, musicians, and conductors) is a huge topic of discussion in the orchestra world, and it's important to analyze data to truly understand the issue. I felt that the message of this pie chart (which is that female composers are underperformed by top US orchestras, and are completely surpassed by Beethoven alone) could have been communicated more clearly and, being that the Women's Philharmonic Advocacy is the only organization I know of that collects this kind of data, I was concerned about how much the audience for this chart truly understands the issue. I wanted to create a visualization that communicates the same message, but in a way that is easier to read and understand.
