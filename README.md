# About me
My name is Emily King. I use she/her pronouns and I am a second year student in the Master of Arts Management program. I grew up in northern Virginia and I have a performing arts background. I did my undergraduate degree in clarinet performance at Indiana University and I hope to work for a performing arts organization or museum one day, doing fundraising or coordinating programs. I love music, building support for the arts, and baking delicious cookies!

# What I hope to learn
One of the reasons why I chose to come to Heinz College is because of the data-driven environment. Data is important to every field, including the arts, and being able to communicate data clearly is a necessary part of advancing a field, solving problems, and building support for a cause. Many arts organizations and programs struggle with securing funds and communicating their importance, and I think training arts managers on "telling stories with data" could be extremely helpful in advancing the field and allowing the public to continue benefitting from arts exposure. With that, I am looking forward to learning how to use the various systems we've downloaded, as well as learning how to appropriately use color, different types of charts, and other aspects of data visualization.
