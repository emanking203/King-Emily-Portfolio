# Outline
For my final project, I want to show that top US orchestras do not feature very many female composers, but are slowly getting better. I hope to encourage my audience to push orchestras to feature more female composers so that the orchestral field can progress, become more relevant to them, and so that diversity, inclusion, and representation will be stronger in their community's art ecosystem.
